## Prerequisites

We recommend work on Linux or on a Unix system, because it's easier to install packages and frameworks; but, if you want to work on Windows you can do it.

### Node (npm)

You must have `node.js` on your computer, you can download it from their [Webpage](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), or just run the following command if you are in a Debian and Ubuntu based Linux distribution.

```shell
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

When you have installed `node.js` you can check your version

```shell
$ node --version
v8.9.4

$ npm --version
5.6.0
```

When you have installed `node.js` with `npm`, install `gulp` (and i recommend to install `yarn` too)

```shell
$ sudo npm install -g gulp
$ curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
$ echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install yarn
```

After install the packages, check them in your system
```shell
$ gulp --version
CLI version 3.9.1

$ yarn --version
1.3.2
```

> If you have any problem installing the packages, visit the [Node webpage](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), or [Yarn webpage](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
